Yesterday I met with a problem with my Laptop(MSI-MODERN 14[B5M]).
Problem:
    I accidentally enabled UEFI boot with CSM.
    I can't able to access the BIOS after this.
    So,I searched the internet how to resolve this issue.
    Everyone suggested to remove the CMOS battery for 2 minutes.
    But,I hadn't have any kit to disassemble my Laptop.
    So,I found a software which helped me to reset CMOS battery.
Solution:
    I have given the software file in this repository.
    First when you open the Application it will show you some terminal.
    Now,select the Action button above and select wipe full data.
    Now, again Action button and select execute.
    It will ask you YES/NO...click Y
    That's it you are all done.
    Now reboot your PC and check whether you can enter into BIOS...Now
